# FINAL_TEST_REPORT — MCP Team Recruit Cleanup

Summary
- Consolidated on Python HTTP MCP server only.
- Added Bearer auth (env `MCP_API_KEY`) to `/mcp` endpoint.
- Added `/healthz` (GET → 200 ok) for health checks.
- Masked PII (contact) in server logs.
- Lowered Cloud Run concurrency to 1 (file-based storage safety).
- Removed Node stdio server and Node tooling.
- Removed unused Python entrypoints and duplicate packaging files.
- Updated client guide to match current prompts (no resource dependencies).

Security
- Deleted committed `.env` with real values. Rotate any exposed tokens/webhooks.
- Server now requires `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_API_KEY>` when `MCP_API_KEY` is set.

Manual Verification
1) Health check
   - `curl -i http://localhost:8080/healthz`
   - Expect: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` and body `ok`
2) Start server (local)
   - `export MCP_API_KEY=demo-key-not-secret`
   - `uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`
3) Initialize via HTTP MCP
   - `curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \`
     `-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \`
     `-H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \`
     `-H 'Authorization: Bearer demo-key-not-secret' \`
     `-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"1.0"},"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05"}}'`
   - Expect: 200 with SSE frames containing a JSON-RPC response.

Tests
- Updated integration test to send Authorization header and set `MCP_API_KEY` before importing server.
- File: `mcp-team-recruit/test_mcp_full.py`

Operational Notes
- Concurrency: set to 1 in Cloud Run deploy script for JSONL storage. Scale up later with external storage (SQLite/Firestore/GCS).
- Logs: contact info masked; Slack payload retains full content for operator visibility.

Next Recommendations
- Add basic rate limiting and request body size limits.
- Move applicant storage to durable backend (SQLite/Firestore) and raise concurrency.
- Pin Python deps or add lockfile for reproducibility.
